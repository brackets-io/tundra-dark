# ..:: Tundra Dark - Brackets Theme ::..

<hr>

Tundra themes for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) are meant to evoke the cool rose shades of the remote northern wilderness.  The colors are very subtle so at first it may seem there is not enough variation.  However, in daily use, it is much more pleasant than themes with greater contrast.
